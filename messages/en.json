    "text-1": "Impuls Medical Institute is a leading private higher education institution in the field of medicine, offering modern education and scientific research. Our primary goal is to train highly qualified personnel in healthcare, provide medical education based on modern technologies, and conduct scientific research.",
    "text-2": "Our History Impuls Medical Institute began its operations in 2022 as the first private medical institute in Namangan region. It was established to address the urgent issue of the shortage of personnel in the medical field. The institute operates under license number 047559 issued by the State Inspectorate for Supervision of Education Quality under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan.",
    "text-3": "Our Educational Process The educational process at our institute is based on a credit-module system, with classes organized in a hybrid format. Our hybrid education system means that students gain practical training offline with leading professors from Uzbekistan and around the world, while also using an integrated system of educational platforms, video lectures, and case studies to support independent learning.",

  "Institut-history": {
    "text-1": "History of Impuls Medical Institute's Opening",
    "text-2": "In 2018, Impulse Multidisciplinary Private Clinic was established in Norin district of Namangan region to provide quality and modern medical assistance to patients. However, the early days of the clinic coincided with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which became a challenging test for the whole world. Despite helping many patients, the clinic couldn't assist everyone due to resource limitations.",
    "text-3": "During the pandemic, obtaining modern technologies, equipment, and medicines required significant funds. The biggest issue was the shortage of qualified doctors. The shortage of medical personnel was a major problem not only for our clinic but across Uzbekistan. Realizing this, we understood the need to take a step towards developing the medical field ourselves.",
    "text-4": "Thus, in 2019, the idea of opening our own medical institute to train qualified personnel in medicine was born. We studied advanced education systems abroad, including medical education and healthcare systems in Europe, Asia, and America, analyzing where the best medical training was provided and how high-quality assistance was delivered to patients.",
    "text-5": "Based on our research, we decided to open a medical institute that aligns with the USMLE system in the United States. We recruited qualified specialists and learned from them to achieve this goal.",
    "text-6": "Finally, in 2022, after several years of efforts, Impulse Medical Institute was opened as the first and only private medical institute in Namangan region under license number 047559 issued by the State Inspectorate for Supervision of Education Quality under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Today, our institute is dedicated to preparing competent specialists in the medical field, based on a modern medical education system."
